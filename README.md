Finding a tutor for a class, or someone to study with, can be a difficult and time consuming task. With that, many potential tutors still remain underutilized by their peers. The aim of our project is to bridge this gap by letting students connect with each other through our app, searching by their classes to find students and/or tutors to aid in their studies.  Users will be able to create an account and log into our system as a student, tutor, or both. Then, they can match up with other users based on their search settings.  In addition to private messaging between users for working together, we plan to implement a message board for classes where users can make posts and ask simple questions to others in their classes.
